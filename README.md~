Your Skills Application for Wantedly Inc Programming Test

This application was built from the ground up for Wantedly Inc. It allows a user to create a profile with an email, username, and password. After creating a login, the user is directed to a feed of other users who have posted their skills. The user can click the 'Your Profile' button at the top right to acces their profile. From there, they can add a photo, biography, and most importantly add skills. 
All of the Specifications were completed:
--> A user can add his/her skill list.
--> A user can recommend and can +1 skills on profile pages of other users.
--> A skill list is sorted by # of +1s.
--> Avoid N+1 database query problem.
--> Deploy to Heroku (or anywhere public) for testing.
