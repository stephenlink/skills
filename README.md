Your Skills Application for Wantedly Inc Programming Test

This application was built from the ground up for Wantedly Inc. It allows a user to create a profile with an email, username, and password. After creating a login, the user is directed to a feed of other users who have posted their skills. These skills are sorted by the date created. The user can click the 'Your Profile' button at the top right to acces their profile. From there, they can add a photo, biography, and most importantly add skills. Other users can also add skills to a different persons profile, and the skills are sorted by number of +1s. 


All of the Specifications were completed:

--> A user can add his/her skill list.

--> A user can recommend and can +1 skills on profile pages of other users.

--> A skill list is sorted by # of +1s.

--> Avoid N+1 database query problem.

--> Deploy to Heroku (or anywhere public) for testing.
